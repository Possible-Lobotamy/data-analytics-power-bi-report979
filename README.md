Milestone 1

A virutal windows machine was created using microsoft azure, and power bi downloaded and installed, so it could be run on a Mac.
An azure SQL database (db) as connected too, and the 'Orders' dataframe (df) imported. 
Using Power Quereies, the 'Orders' df was modified seperating the [Order date] and [shipping date] columns (cols) and removing null values from [Order date].
[Card Number] col deleted for privacy.
'Products' df imported from a .csv file then duplicates removed from the [product_code] col.
'Stores' df imported from Azure blob storage and all misnamed values in the [Region] col renamed correctly.
Three 'Customers'.csv df, each showing different regions of customers, combined and transformed into one df.
[First Name] and [Last Name] combined into one [Full Name] col in the 'Customers' df and index col delted.
All col names changed to the named convention of captials and spaces e.g. [Naming Convention]
